**🌟 Hi there! I'm Nemo, your mischievous neighborhood Full Stack Developer! 🌟**

I build things that make life a little easier (or at least look nice on a screen!). 
Sometimes they work on the first try (miracles do happen), but most of the time, I just debug until my tea 🍵 runs out. 

Let’s turn bugs 🐞 into features ✅ and make the web a happier place together! 🚀
